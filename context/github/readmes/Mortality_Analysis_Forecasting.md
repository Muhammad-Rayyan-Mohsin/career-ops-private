## ⚙️ Architecture & Pipeline

The system follows a modular pipeline:

1.  **Data Ingestion:** Reads raw mortality data (e.g., CSV files).
2.  **Preprocessing:** Cleans, standardizes, normalizes, and chunks data for efficient processing.
3.  **Analysis:** Performs aggregations, calculates statistics, and detects patterns/trends.
4.  **Anomaly Correction:** Applies specific corrections (like 1990 interpolation) and standardizations.
5.  **Validation:** Runs data integrity checks (consistency, missing data, outliers).
6.  **Visualization:** Generates static (Matplotlib/Seaborn) and interactive (Plotly/Streamlit) charts.
7.  **Forecasting:** Trains the SARIMAX model and generates future projections.

The code is structured with separate modules for different functionalities (preprocessing, analysis, visualization, forecasting) and utilizes object-oriented principles where appropriate.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.8+
*   pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/mortality-data-analysis.git
    cd mortality-data-analysis
    ```
2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Prepare your data:**
    *   Place your raw mortality data files (e.g., CSV) in the designated data directory (e.g., `data/raw/`).
    *   Ensure the file structure or naming conventions match what the ingestion scripts expect (update configurations if needed).

### Usage

1.  **Run the main analysis pipeline (if applicable as a script):**
    ```bash
    # Example: python run_analysis.py --input_dir data/raw/ --output_dir data/processed/
    # Adjust command based on your project structure
    ```
2.  **Launch the Interactive Dashboard:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
    (Replace `app.py` with the actual name of your main Streamlit script).

3.  Open your web browser and navigate to the local URL provided by Streamlit (usually `http://localhost:8501`).

## 📈 Key Findings & Impact

This system has successfully:

*   **Improved Data Quality:** Corrected a major ~10% undercount in 1990 data and standardized inconsistent state/date formats.
*   **Revealed Trends:** Identified consistent seasonal mortality patterns (winter peaks) and long-term upward trends correlating with population growth.
*   **Quantified Anomalies:** Detected and highlighted unusual events, notably the ~18.5% increase in deaths during 2020 (linked to COVID-19).
*   **Enabled State Comparisons:** Provided tools for analyzing variations in mortality across different states (for available years).
*   **Provided Future Outlook:** Implemented forecasting capabilities to project future mortality trends with quantifiable uncertainty.
*   **Enhanced User Experience:** Delivered an interactive dashboard for intuitive data exploration and analysis.
